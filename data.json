    "paragraph1": "Dr. Manmohan Singh was, without a doubt, the most approachable and supportive boss I had during my 42 years in government service. He was gentle, compassionate, and open to diverse viewpoints, encouraging thoughtful discussions and reasoned debates. However, this openness came with an expectation: you needed to be well-prepared and thoroughly informed. His keen intellect quickly cut through any pretense or lack of knowledge, and he did not hesitate to express his disapproval of those who attempted to mislead him.",
    "detailedHeadingSection2": "",
    "paragraph2": "\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDr. Manmohan Singh's Approach to Foreign and Security Policy\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy interactions with Dr. Manmohan Singh primarily revolved around foreign and security policy. He had no illusions about how the world worked and approached issues with remarkable clarity. His extensive experience on the global stage had made him pragmatic, yet not cynical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003ECredibility and Honesty in Diplomacy\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHe firmly believed that in diplomacy, credibility is paramount—honesty truly is the best policy. Not necessarily full transparency, but honesty. When dealing with international actors beyond one’s control and equipped with independent sources of information, credibility becomes the foundation. And credibility was something Dr. Singh possessed in abundance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe world deeply respected his intellect and integrity, and he consistently leveraged this respect for India’s benefit. I witnessed firsthand how global leaders sought his advice, valued his insights, and respected his influence at forums like the G-20 and East Asia Summit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDr. Singh's Global Influence\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s no surprise that former U.S. President Barack Obama fondly referred to him as his “guru.” The teacher in Dr. Singh was ever-present. A meeting with him always left you better informed and with a clearer perspective. You inevitably learned something valuable—an exceedingly rare experience for those familiar with the workings of government.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELeadership Without Propaganda or Coercion\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorking with Dr. Manmohan Singh meant working with a truly uncommon leader—a politician who was neither a short-term opportunist nor one to compromise on integrity. He was a visionary whose life exemplified what could be achieved through skill, knowledge, and hard work. Unlike many, he never relied on propaganda, rhetoric, or coercion to lead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EClarity of Purpose in Foreign Policy\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat struck me time and again was his remarkable lucidity, even on topics that might have been unfamiliar to him. This clarity stemmed from his well-defined sense of purpose. He approached foreign policy through the lens of political economy, emphasizing its role in transforming India into a modern, prosperous, and secure nation for all its citizens. This perspective allowed him to discern both threats and opportunities, often recognizing one within the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERecognizing Opportunities Within Challenges\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, during the Colombo government’s military campaign against the LTTE in 2009, which posed significant political challenges for India, he identified an opportunity to ensure that Sri Lanka respected India’s security priorities, such as prohibiting foreign submarine port calls—a commitment successfully upheld until 2014.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EChampioning National Interests Against All Odds\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHis clarity of purpose also gave him the resolve to champion issues he believed were in the national interest, even against considerable odds. The civil nuclear agreement with the United States and the NSG waiver are prime examples. Despite facing daunting political hurdles within India, it was Dr. Singh’s unwavering determination that kept the process moving forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EUnwavering Determination for India’s Future\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHis willingness to risk the future of his government to secure these agreements revealed a side of him that his gentle demeanor often concealed. Dr. Manmohan Singh’s leadership was a rare blend of vision, integrity, and quiet strength—a testament to the transformative power of purpose-driven action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E",

  "paragraph1": "Recently, the rise of respiratory viruses around the world has captured the attention of the medical community. Among these, Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) has become a virus of particular concern, with a notable increase in reported cases globally. Although HMPV is not a new virus, the recent uptick in cases, especially in India, has raised alarms among health authorities and the public. In this article, we will cover everything you need to know about HMPV, including its symptoms, how it spreads, preventive measures, and the current situation in India.",

  "paragraph2": "<section class=\"content\" style=\"max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; background-color: #ffffff;\">\n    <h2><b> What is HMPV?</b> </h2>\n    <p>Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a respiratory virus that mainly impacts the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Identified in 2001, HMPV shares similarities with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is another prevalent virus responsible for serious respiratory infections in young children and older adults. Both HMPV and RSV belong to the Pneumoviridae family, which also encompasses the more familiar human parainfluenza virus.</p>\n\n    <h2 style=\"color: #2c3e50;\"><b>Transmission of HMPV</b></h2>\n    <p>HMPV is very contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes. Similar to other respiratory viruses, it can also be transmitted by touching surfaces that have been contaminated and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>\n\n    <p>The virus usually spreads during the winter and spring seasons, when respiratory illnesses are more prevalent. This highlights the importance of staying alert about preventive measures, especially during the colder months.</p>\n\n    <h2 style=\"color: #2c3e50;\"><b>Symptoms of HMPV</b></h2>\n    <p>HMPV symptoms often resemble those of a common cold or flu. Many people may not even realize they have HMPV since the symptoms are usually mild. However, in certain populations, the virus can result in serious complications, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis, which may necessitate medical intervention.</p>\n\n    <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Cough:</strong> A persistent cough is one of the main symptoms of HMPV and can last for several days.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Runny or Stuffy Nose:</strong> Nasal congestion is frequent, making it hard to breathe through the nose.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Sore Throat:</strong> Many people report a scratchy or sore throat.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Fever:</strong> A low-grade fever is often present, though its intensity can vary based on the infection's severity.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Wheezing:</strong> In more severe cases, HMPV can cause wheezing, making it difficult for individuals to breathe normally.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Shortness of Breath:</strong> This symptom is more common in those with pre-existing lung conditions or weakened immune systems.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>While most people recover from HMPV without complications, the virus can be more serious for the following groups:</p>\n\n    <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Young Children:</strong> Particularly those under five, as their immune systems are still developing.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>The Elderly:</strong> Older adults often have weaker immune systems and face a higher risk of complications.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>People with Weakened Immune Systems:</strong> Individuals undergoing treatments like chemotherapy or those with HIV/AIDS may be more susceptible to severe respiratory infections.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>In some instances, HMPV can lead to pneumonia, bronchiolitis, or asthma flare-ups, which may require hospitalization.</p>\n\n    <h3><b>The Growing Concern in India</b></h3>\n    <p>India has recently experienced an increase in HMPV cases, prompting concern from the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and various state health departments. Reports indicate that the first confirmed cases of HMPV in India emerged in early January 2025, with seven individuals testing positive for the virus. While these initial cases are not particularly alarming, it is essential to monitor the situation closely, as respiratory viruses can spread rapidly, especially in densely populated urban areas.</p>\n\n    <p>In response, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has released guidelines for managing HMPV cases, urging hospitals and healthcare professionals to remain alert for symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. Nevertheless, health experts have reassured the public that there is no need for widespread panic at this time.</p>\n\n    <p>HMPV is not a new virus, and there have been numerous cases reported globally in the past. However, its emergence in India warrants attention, as it could lead to an increase in infections if preventive measures are not implemented.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c3e50;\"><b>Is HMPV as Dangerous as COVID-19?</b></h3>\n    <p>A common question that many people have is whether HMPV is as dangerous as COVID-19. While both are respiratory viruses, there are important differences between them.</p>\n\n    <p>COVID-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has a higher mortality rate and can lead to severe symptoms, including long-term effects known as \"long COVID.\" In contrast, HMPV usually results in milder respiratory symptoms, and most individuals recover within a week or two. The fatality rate for HMPV is significantly lower than that of COVID-19.</p>\n\n    <p>However, similar to COVID-19, HMPV can cause serious complications in vulnerable groups, which is why health experts stress the importance of preventive measures.</p>\n\n    <h2 style=\"color: #2c3e50;\">Preventing the Spread of HMPV</h2>\n    <p>Preventing the spread of HMPV involves using the same strategies that help control other respiratory viruses, like influenza, RSV, and COVID-19. Here are some important preventive measures:</p>\n\n    <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Practice Good Hygiene:</strong> One of the best ways to minimize the spread of respiratory viruses is by maintaining good hand hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or touching surfaces in public. If soap and water aren’t available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Avoid Close Contact:</strong> Keep your distance from individuals who are exhibiting symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing and sneezing. If you are feeling unwell, it’s crucial to stay home to prevent spreading the virus to others.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Wear Masks in Crowded Areas:</strong> Wearing a mask can help lower the transmission of respiratory viruses, especially in crowded or enclosed spaces like public transport or indoor gatherings.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Disinfect Frequently-Touched Surfaces:</strong> Viruses can survive on surfaces for a long time, so it’s important to regularly disinfect commonly touched areas, such as doorknobs, light switches, and smartphones.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Get Vaccinated:</strong> Although there is no specific vaccine for HMPV at this time, vaccines for other respiratory viruses, like the flu and COVID-19, can help lessen the overall impact of respiratory illnesses, which may decrease the likelihood of contracting HMPV.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Keep Your Immune System Strong:</strong> Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help shield you from viral infections. Focus on eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, getting sufficient sleep, and managing stress to strengthen your immune system.</li>\n    </ul>\n</section>",
