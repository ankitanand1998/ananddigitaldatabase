    "paragraph1": "Dr. Manmohan Singh was, without a doubt, the most approachable and supportive boss I had during my 42 years in government service. He was gentle, compassionate, and open to diverse viewpoints, encouraging thoughtful discussions and reasoned debates. However, this openness came with an expectation: you needed to be well-prepared and thoroughly informed. His keen intellect quickly cut through any pretense or lack of knowledge, and he did not hesitate to express his disapproval of those who attempted to mislead him.",
    "detailedHeadingSection2": "",
    "paragraph2": "\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDr. Manmohan Singh's Approach to Foreign and Security Policy\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy interactions with Dr. Manmohan Singh primarily revolved around foreign and security policy. He had no illusions about how the world worked and approached issues with remarkable clarity. His extensive experience on the global stage had made him pragmatic, yet not cynical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003ECredibility and Honesty in Diplomacy\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHe firmly believed that in diplomacy, credibility is paramount—honesty truly is the best policy. Not necessarily full transparency, but honesty. When dealing with international actors beyond one’s control and equipped with independent sources of information, credibility becomes the foundation. And credibility was something Dr. Singh possessed in abundance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe world deeply respected his intellect and integrity, and he consistently leveraged this respect for India’s benefit. I witnessed firsthand how global leaders sought his advice, valued his insights, and respected his influence at forums like the G-20 and East Asia Summit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDr. Singh's Global Influence\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s no surprise that former U.S. President Barack Obama fondly referred to him as his “guru.” The teacher in Dr. Singh was ever-present. A meeting with him always left you better informed and with a clearer perspective. You inevitably learned something valuable—an exceedingly rare experience for those familiar with the workings of government.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELeadership Without Propaganda or Coercion\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorking with Dr. Manmohan Singh meant working with a truly uncommon leader—a politician who was neither a short-term opportunist nor one to compromise on integrity. He was a visionary whose life exemplified what could be achieved through skill, knowledge, and hard work. Unlike many, he never relied on propaganda, rhetoric, or coercion to lead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EClarity of Purpose in Foreign Policy\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat struck me time and again was his remarkable lucidity, even on topics that might have been unfamiliar to him. This clarity stemmed from his well-defined sense of purpose. He approached foreign policy through the lens of political economy, emphasizing its role in transforming India into a modern, prosperous, and secure nation for all its citizens. This perspective allowed him to discern both threats and opportunities, often recognizing one within the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERecognizing Opportunities Within Challenges\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, during the Colombo government’s military campaign against the LTTE in 2009, which posed significant political challenges for India, he identified an opportunity to ensure that Sri Lanka respected India’s security priorities, such as prohibiting foreign submarine port calls—a commitment successfully upheld until 2014.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EChampioning National Interests Against All Odds\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHis clarity of purpose also gave him the resolve to champion issues he believed were in the national interest, even against considerable odds. The civil nuclear agreement with the United States and the NSG waiver are prime examples. Despite facing daunting political hurdles within India, it was Dr. Singh’s unwavering determination that kept the process moving forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EUnwavering Determination for India’s Future\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHis willingness to risk the future of his government to secure these agreements revealed a side of him that his gentle demeanor often concealed. Dr. Manmohan Singh’s leadership was a rare blend of vision, integrity, and quiet strength—a testament to the transformative power of purpose-driven action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E",
