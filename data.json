    "paragraph2": "<section><h2>Is Blogging Dead in 2025? Know the Harsh Reality</h2><br> <p>Over the past few years, the blogging industry has undergone significant changes. Many successful bloggers who once earned substantial revenue through their websites are now struggling or have completely lost their online presence. The primary reason behind this decline is the evolving search engine algorithms, particularly Google's AI-driven updates. Websites that previously ranked well with basic SEO strategies are now failing to maintain their positions. </p><br> <p>One of the major shifts is the reduced effectiveness of organic search traffic. Google now prioritizes well-established websites with strong domain authority, making it harder for new and smaller blogs to gain traction. Bloggers who have been in the industry for years are witnessing a drop in their rankings, traffic, and revenue. As a result, relying solely on blogging as a career has become riskier than ever.</p><br> <p>Additionally, the rise of AI-generated content has impacted individual bloggers. Users now get instant answers from AI summaries, eliminating the need to visit multiple blogs for information. If a blog doesn’t offer unique, in-depth insights beyond AI-generated content, it becomes difficult to attract and retain readers. This harsh reality forces aspiring bloggers to rethink their strategies before investing time and money into <a href='https://ananddigitalblog.vercel.app/how-to-start-your-personal-blog' rel='nofollow'>starting blogging in 2025</a>. </p><br> </section> <section> <h2>Why Old Blogging Methods No Longer Work?</h2> <p>Traditional blogging strategies that once worked seamlessly are now obsolete. Earlier, many bloggers succeeded by identifying high-volume keywords, outsourcing low-cost content, and publishing articles in bulk. This method helped them rank on Google quickly and monetize their websites through AdSense and affiliate marketing. However, in 2025, this approach is ineffective. </p><br> <p>Google’s algorithm updates now prioritize high-quality, user-centric content over mass-produced articles. Previously, bloggers could rank by stuffing keywords and using clickbait headlines, but now, search engines focus on expertise, authority, and trustworthiness (E-A-T). Websites that lack original, valuable content struggle to rank.</p><br> <p>Another outdated tactic is backlink manipulation, where bloggers purchased or exchanged backlinks to boost rankings artificially. Today, Google penalizes such practices, and poor-quality backlinks can lead to website deindexing. AI-generated content has also reduced the demand for generic blog posts. If an article does not provide insights beyond what AI already summarizes, users won’t visit the blog.</p><br> <p>For bloggers to succeed, they must move beyond old-school SEO tricks and focus on delivering high-value, research-driven content. Understanding audience intent, solving real problems, and maintaining content authenticity are now the keys to long-term success. Read more about <a href='https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-strategic-insights-tactical-advice/383325/'>SEO strategies in 2025</a> to improve your blogging approach.</p><br> </section> <section> <h2>The Decline of Traditional Blogging?</h2><br> <h3>Search Engine Ranking Changes</h3><br> <p>Google’s ranking algorithm has drastically changed, making it more challenging for new blogs to rank organically. Earlier, when users searched for a topic, the best-matching blog posts would appear at the top. However, in 2025, the first results are often AI-generated overviews from Google, reducing the chances of users clicking on individual blogs. </p><br> <p>Another significant change is the preference for authoritative sources. News websites like Times of India, Aaj Tak, and The Guardian are dominating search rankings because they are well-established and trusted by search engines. Even if a small blogger writes in-depth, high-quality content, it is unlikely to outrank these major publishers.</p><br> <p>Additionally, platforms like Reddit, Quora, and user-generated content forums are gaining traction in search results. Google values real-user discussions, making it difficult for traditional blogs to compete. This shift forces new bloggers to rethink their SEO strategies. Instead of targeting broad, high-competition keywords, they need to focus on niche topics where AI-generated results do not provide complete answers.</p><br> <p>To survive, bloggers must create unique, research-based content that fills gaps left by AI summaries and mainstream media. Relying solely on SEO for traffic is no longer sustainable. Learn about <a href='https://elementor.com/blog/profitable-blog-niches/' rel='nofollow'>why niche blogging is important in 2025</a>.</p><br> </section> <section> <h2>The Myth of Expired Domains</h2><br> <p>Many bloggers have used expired domains as a shortcut to ranking faster. The idea was to buy domains that previously had authority and backlinks, then repurpose them with new content. This strategy worked well in the past, but recent updates have made it ineffective.</p><br> <p>Google now closely monitors domain history and penalizes expired domains that attempt to manipulate rankings. While an expired domain may initially rank, its position is unstable, and Google may eventually remove it from search results. This unpredictability makes it a risky investment for new bloggers.</p><br> <p>Additionally, an expired domain’s backlinks may no longer hold value if they are irrelevant to the new content. Search engines now focus more on content relevance and credibility rather than past authority. Instead of relying on shortcuts, bloggers should focus on building genuine, high-quality content and earning organic backlinks.</p><br> <p>If someone still wants to use expired domains, they must ensure that the previous domain history aligns with their niche. Otherwise, the effort and money spent on acquiring such domains might go to waste. Read more about <a href='https://www.bigrock.in/blog/products/domains/expired-domains-vs-fresh-domains' rel='nofollow'>whether expired domains are still a good SEO strategy</a>.</p><br> </section> <section> <h2>Blogging Should Be a Side Gig, Not a Full-Time Career</h2><br> <p>The dynamic nature of the blogging industry makes it an unreliable full-time career in 2025. Unlike a decade ago, when bloggers could generate stable income from AdSense and affiliate marketing, today’s landscape is far more unpredictable.</p><br> <p>Search engine algorithm changes, AI-generated content, and increasing competition make it difficult to sustain long-term income from blogging alone. Many bloggers invest years into their websites only to see their traffic drop due to sudden Google updates.</p><br> <p>For these reasons, it’s advisable to treat blogging as a side hustle or passive income stream rather than a primary source of income. This way, bloggers can explore multiple revenue streams without financial dependence on search engine rankings.</p><br> <p>The best approach is to use blogging as a platform to build expertise in a niche and then monetize skills through consulting, freelancing, online courses, or brand collaborations. Learn more about whether blogging or freelancing is better in 2025</p><br> </section> <section> <h2>Conclusion</h2><br> <p>The blogging landscape has changed dramatically, making it difficult for new bloggers to rely on outdated strategies. Google’s AI-driven search results and preference for authoritative websites have reduced organic traffic opportunities for small blogs. Traditional SEO tricks like keyword stuffing, expired domains, and mass content production no longer work. Instead, bloggers must focus on niche content, website optimization, and value-driven articles to attract readers. Blogging should be considered a side gig rather than a full-time career due to its unpredictable nature. However, it still offers valuable opportunities to learn digital marketing, SEO, and content creation skills, which can be monetized through freelancing and other avenues. The key to success in 2025 is to diversify content across multiple platforms, choose the right niche, and provide unique insights that AI cannot fully answer.</p> </section> <section> <h3>Author: Ankit Anand</h3><br> <p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankit-anand-ankit-mishra-0073b2144/' rel='follow'>Ankit Anand</a> is an experienced SEO professional with extensive expertise in content writing and blogging.

Your niche should be something you are passionate about, knowledgeable in, and has audience demand. Picking the wrong niche can make it difficult to stay motivated and attract an audience. Here’s how to select the right one:</p> <ul> <li>Identify your interests – Choose a topic you genuinely enjoy and can write about consistently. Blogging takes time, so picking a topic you're passionate about will keep you engaged.</li> <li>Research audience demand – Use tools like Google Trends, Ubersuggest, Ahrefs, or SEMrush to check if people are searching for your topic. A high search volume indicates a demand for content in that niche.</li> <li>Check competition levels – A highly competitive niche may be harder to rank in, while a low-competition niche may lack an audience. Find a balance where you can compete but still attract readers.</li> <li>Consider monetization potential – If your goal is to make money from blogging, ensure your niche has monetization opportunities like affiliate marketing, sponsored content, or digital products.</li> </ul> <p><b>See If Your Blog Name Is Available<b></p> <p>Your blog’s name (domain name) is your online identity.

Here’s a quick breakdown of your options:</p> <ul> <li>Free blogging platforms: Platforms like Medium, Blogger, and WordPress.com offer free options but come with limitations in design, customization, and monetization.</li> <li>Self-hosted platforms: WordPress.org is the best option for full control, advanced features, and monetization opportunities. You’ll need to purchase web hosting, but it’s worth the investment.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Basic setup steps:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Choose a hosting provider (if self-hosted).</li> <li>Install WordPress (most hosts offer a one-click install).</li> <li>Customize your site with themes, plugins, and settings.</li> </ul> <p><b>Best Free & Paid Blog Hosting Options</b></p> <ul> <li>Free Hosting: Blogger (by Google), WordPress.com (limited features), Medium.</li> <li>Paid Hosting: Bluehost, SiteGround, Hostinger – these offer better speed, security, and customization.</li> </ul> <p><b>How to Set Up a Blog with WordPress</b></p> <ul> <li>Purchase hosting and register your domain.</li> <li>Install WordPress (one-click install available with most hosting providers).</li> <li>Log in to your WordPress dashboard and start customizing.</li> </ul> <p><b>Registering Your Blog’s Domain Name</p></b> <ul> <li>Pick a .com domain for credibility.</li> <li>Use domain registrars like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Bluehost.</li> <li>Keep it short, brandable, and easy to spell.</li> </ul> <h3>Step 3 – Customize Your Blog for a Professional Look</h3> <br><h4>Essential Blog Design Elements for a User-Friendly WordPress Website</h4> <p>Log in to WordPress using yourblog.com/wp-admin.

  "paragraph1": "Recently, the rise of respiratory viruses around the world has captured the attention of the medical community. Among these, Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) has become a virus of particular concern, with a notable increase in reported cases globally. Although HMPV is not a new virus, the recent uptick in cases, especially in India, has raised alarms among health authorities and the public. In this article, we will cover everything you need to know about HMPV, including its symptoms, how it spreads, preventive measures, and the current situation in India.",
  "detailedHeadingSection2": "",
  "paragraph2": "<section class=\"content\" style=\"max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; background-color: #ffffff;\">\n\n\n    <h2><b> What is HMPV?</b> </h2><br>    <p>Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a respiratory virus that mainly impacts the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Identified in 2001, HMPV shares similarities with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is another prevalent virus responsible for serious respiratory infections in young children and older adults. Both HMPV and RSV belong to the Pneumoviridae family, which also encompasses the more familiar human parainfluenza virus.</p>\n\n    <h2 style=\"color: #2c3e50;\"><b>Transmission of HMPV</b></h2><br>   <p>HMPV is very contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes. Similar to other respiratory viruses, it can also be transmitted by touching surfaces that have been contaminated and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>\n\n    <p>The virus usually spreads during the winter and spring seasons, when respiratory illnesses are more prevalent. This highlights the importance of staying alert about preventive measures, especially during the colder months.</p><br>    <h2 style=\"color: #2c3e50;\"><b>Symptoms of HMPV</b></h2><br>    <p>HMPV symptoms often resemble those of a common cold or flu. Many people may not even realize they have HMPV since the symptoms are usually mild. However, in certain populations, the virus can result in serious complications, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis, which may necessitate medical intervention.</p>\n\n    <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><br>       <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Cough:</strong> A persistent cough is one of the main symptoms of HMPV and can last for several days.</li><br>       <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Runny or Stuffy Nose:</strong> Nasal congestion is frequent, making it hard to breathe through the nose.</li><br>       <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Sore Throat:</strong> Many people report a scratchy or sore throat.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Fever:</strong> A low-grade fever is often present, though its intensity can vary based on the infection's severity.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Wheezing:</strong> In more severe cases, HMPV can cause wheezing, making it difficult for individuals to breathe normally.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Shortness of Breath:</strong> This symptom is more common in those with pre-existing lung conditions or weakened immune systems.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>While most people recover from HMPV without complications, the virus can be more serious for the following groups:</p><br>    <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><br        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Young Children:</strong> Particularly those under five, as their immune systems are still developing.</li><br>     <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>The Elderly:</strong> Older adults often have weaker immune systems and face a higher risk of complications.</li><br>        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>People with Weakened Immune Systems:</strong> Individuals undergoing treatments like chemotherapy or those with HIV/AIDS may be more susceptible to severe respiratory infections.</li><br>    </ul><br>    <p>In some instances, HMPV can lead to pneumonia, bronchiolitis, or asthma flare-ups, which may require hospitalization.</p><br>    <h3><b>The Growing Concern in India</b></h3><br>    <p>India has recently experienced an increase in HMPV cases, prompting concern from the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and various state health departments. Reports indicate that the first confirmed cases of HMPV in India emerged in early January 2025, with seven individuals testing positive for the virus. While these initial cases are not particularly alarming, it is essential to monitor the situation closely, as respiratory viruses can spread rapidly, especially in densely populated urban areas.</p><br>    <p>In response, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has released guidelines for managing HMPV cases, urging hospitals and healthcare professionals to remain alert for symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. Nevertheless, health experts have reassured the public that there is no need for widespread panic at this time.</p><br>   <p>HMPV is not a new virus, and there have been numerous cases reported globally in the past. However, its emergence in India warrants attention, as it could lead to an increase in infections if preventive measures are not implemented.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c3e50;\"><b>Is HMPV as Dangerous as COVID-19?</b></h3>\n    <p>A common question that many people have is whether HMPV is as dangerous as COVID-19. While both are respiratory viruses, there are important differences between them.</p>\n\n    <p>COVID-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has a higher mortality rate and can lead to severe symptoms, including long-term effects known as \"long COVID.\" In contrast, HMPV usually results in milder respiratory symptoms, and most individuals recover within a week or two. The fatality rate for HMPV is significantly lower than that of COVID-19.</p>\n\n    <p>However, similar to COVID-19, HMPV can cause serious complications in vulnerable groups, which is why health experts stress the importance of preventive measures.</p>\n\n    <h2 style=\"color: #2c3e50;\">Preventing the Spread of HMPV</h2>\n    <p>Preventing the spread of HMPV involves using the same strategies that help control other respiratory viruses, like influenza, RSV, and COVID-19. Here are some important preventive measures:</p>\n\n    <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Practice Good Hygiene:</strong> One of the best ways to minimize the spread of respiratory viruses is by maintaining good hand hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or touching surfaces in public. If soap and water aren’t available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Avoid Close Contact:</strong> Keep your distance from individuals who are exhibiting symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing and sneezing. If you are feeling unwell, it’s crucial to stay home to prevent spreading the virus to others.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Wear Masks in Crowded Areas:</strong> Wearing a mask can help lower the transmission of respiratory viruses, especially in crowded or enclosed spaces like public transport or indoor gatherings.</li><br>        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Disinfect Frequently-Touched Surfaces:</strong> Viruses can survive on surfaces for a long time, so it’s important to regularly disinfect commonly touched areas, such as doorknobs, light switches, and smartphones.</li><br>       <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Get Vaccinated:</strong> Although there is no specific vaccine for HMPV at this time, vaccines for other respiratory viruses, like the flu and COVID-19, can help lessen the overall impact of respiratory illnesses, which may decrease the likelihood of contracting HMPV.</li><br>        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Keep Your Immune System Strong:</strong> Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help shield you from viral infections. Focus on eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, getting sufficient sleep, and managing stress to strengthen your immune system.</li><br>    </ul>\n</section>",
